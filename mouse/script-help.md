# script helper

### type: executor

``_G.keycode = 'C' --[[ change to any key you want ]]``
<br>
``_G.notifications = false --[[ set true to enable notifications ]]``
<br>
``loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Melishy/melishy-scripts/main/mouse/toggle-mouse.lua", true))("dsc.gg/melishy")``

if your executor doesnt support ``HttpGet()`` then:
- open https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Melishy/melishy-scripts/main/mouse/toggle-mouse.lua
- copy entire code & paste to executor
- add the code to line 1:
<br>
``_G.keycode = 'C' --[[ change to any key you want ]]``
<br>
``_G.notifications = false --[[ set true to enable notifications ]]``
  
- enjoy toggling your mouse!
